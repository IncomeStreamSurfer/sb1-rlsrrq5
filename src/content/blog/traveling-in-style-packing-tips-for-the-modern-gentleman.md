## Essential Items for Every Trip

Regardless of destination, include these basics:

1. Underwear and socks (one pair per day, plus extras)

3. [Trousers](https://2men.it/collections/pants) or [jeans](https://2men.it/collections/jeans)
4. Comfortable walking shoes
5. Jacket or [blazer](https://2men.it/collections/blazers)
6. Sleepwear
7. Toiletries

## Choosing Travel-Friendly Fabrics

Opt for fabrics that:

1. Resist wrinkles (e.g., wool, polyester blends)
2. Dry quickly
3. Maintain shape after packing

Avoid 100% cotton items, which wrinkle easily and take longer to dry.

## Packing Techniques

Maximize space and minimize wrinkles with these methods:

1. Rolling: For casual items like t-shirts and underwear
2. Folding: For stiffer items like dress shirts and trousers
3. Bundle wrapping: For longer trips with multiple outfits
4. Using packing cubes: To organize and compress clothing

## Packing Suits and Formal Wear

For business trips or formal events:

1. Wear your suit jacket on the plane to avoid packing it
2. Use a garment bag for multiple suits
3. Turn suits inside out and fold them using tissue paper
4. Pack dress shirts in plastic dry-cleaning bags to reduce wrinkles
