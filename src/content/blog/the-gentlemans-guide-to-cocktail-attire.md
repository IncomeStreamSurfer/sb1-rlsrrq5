## The Foundation: Suits and Separates

The core of cocktail attire for men is usually:

1. A well-fitted [suit](https://2men.it/collections/suits) in a dark color (navy, charcoal, or black)
2. Alternatively, tailored separates (blazer and trousers)

For a more contemporary look, consider:

- A [patterned suit](https://2men.it/collections/italian-designer-plaids-check-suits) (subtle checks or pinstripes)
- A [colored blazer](https://2men.it/collections/blazers) paired with dark trousers

## Shirts for Cocktail Events

Choose shirts that complement your suit or separates:

1. Crisp [white dress shirt](https://2men.it/collections/shirts) (always appropriate)
2. Pastel or jewel-toned shirts for a pop of color
3. Subtle patterns like small checks or stripes

Ensure the shirt is well-fitted and wrinkle-free.

## Footwear for Cocktail Attire

Shoes should be polished and elegant:

1. Oxford or derby shoes in black or dark brown
2. Loafers for a slightly more casual look
3. Patent leather shoes for more formal cocktail events

Avoid overly casual shoes like sneakers or boat shoes.

## Accessorizing Your Cocktail Look

The right accessories can elevate your cocktail attire:

1. Tie or bow tie (optional, but adds sophistication)
2. Pocket square (choose a color that complements, not matches, your tie)
3. Cufflinks for French cuff shirts
4. A dress watch with a leather strap

Remember, less is often more with accessories.

## Seasonal Considerations

Adapt your cocktail attire to the season:

1. Spring/Summer:
   - Lighter colors and fabrics

2. Fall/Winter:
   - Richer, deeper colors
   - Heavier fabrics like wool or velvet
   - Layer with a [waistcoat](https://2men.it/collections/all) for extra warmth and style

## Cocktail Attire for Different Occasions

Adjust your outfit based on the specific event:

1. Wedding: Err on the side of formality
2. Corporate event: Keep it professional with classic colors
3. Holiday party: Incorporate festive elements subtly
4. Summer soirée: Lighter fabrics and colors

4. Over-accessorizing
5. Wearing overly bright or flashy colors
